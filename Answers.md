Below are answers on the questions raised during the tutorials. They are in no way exhaustive and unique, many questions do not actually have a clear answer.

## Proteomics Data

#### :thought_balloon:1

The gaps correspond to acquisition time where the instrument is not measuring MS1 spectra. For example, the instrument can be fragmenting or acquiring MSn spectra.


#### :thought_balloon:2

In a proteomics sample, we expect peaks in MS1 to be the detection of ionized peptides. In MS2, we expect peaks to be the product of the fragmentation of peptides, i.e. fragment ions. Note however that while the mass spectrometer is tuned to target peptides and peptide fragments, other species can be recorded, like small molecules, sugars, or lipids.


## Proteomics Identification

#### :thought_balloon:3

Peptide ionization is a competitive process. Some peptides managed to capture three charges while others were left with only two.


#### :thought_balloon:4

The peptides identified cover the protein sequence only partially. Some parts of the sequence cannot be identified with the protease used, and some parts could be identified but this was not achieved in our experiment. 100% sample coverage requires a distribution of cleavage sites allowing the generation of detectable peptides over the entire sequence, and a high yield in peptide identification. In practice it is extremely rare.


#### :thought_balloon:5

A coverage of 99% corresponds to a false negative rate (FNR) of 1%.


## Proteomics Quantification

#### :thought_balloon:6

There are many flavors of box plots. You will find details on the implementation in the function help `?geom_boxplot`.

#### :thought_balloon:7

We subtract when working with log-transformed ratios, this corresponds to a division of ratios.
